									<p>My life isn't exactly easy to explain. But I will warn you, part of my bio is going to be sad as ---k. Sorry for my language!
									To start my bio, I'll speak a bit about my early life. I was born on August 4, 2003 in Macomb, Michigan. Yes I have lived here
								for nearly 18 long years. I sounded just like Rapunzel, didn't I? I can't say much about the first 2 years of my life because I don't
							remember anything from those years. The oldest memories I have are from when I was only 3 years old. And those were my potty training years!
						Up until I was 4 years old, I mainly stayed at home. I started going to school when I was 4 years old at a private school. Yes it costed my
					parents A LOT of money! I went there for the first 4-5 years of my eduaction before transfering over to L'Anse Creuse Public Schools. My older
				sister, Kathryn, was already attending L'Anse Creuse Public Schools when I got there. This is where my life started to take a turn for the worst.
			I'd rather not talk about most of it because it upsets me, but I will bring up a few notable things. The first things is I was in a psychiatric ward for about
		2 weeks when I was in 8th grade. Not long after that, I lost my grandfather on my dad's side of my family. A little over a year later, I lost my uncle on my
	dad's side of the family. Not even a year after that, I ended up in a psychiatric ward, AGAIN! The reason why I ended up in a psychiatric ward is something I'd
rather not say, AT ALL! Unless if some asks me.</p>
									<p>My home life is pretty typical of most American teenagers. I live with my parents. I have 3 sisters. One is older than me by 19 months.
									The other 2 are younger than me by 5 years for the first little sister and 7 years for the youngest.NO BROTHERS! I also have many animals
								  in my house. I have 3 dogs(a Golden Retriever, a Yorkie-Westland Terrier Mix, and a Yorkie), a Beta Fish(his name is Blue),
							   a Tortoise(her name is Rocky), and a Bearded Dragon(his name is Pablo). I live in the suburbs in a 15 room house with 3 floors(basement included)
							and a decently sized backyard. My room is small though!</p>
									<p>My life has gotten better over the years compared to what it once was. I still have my issues like any teenager.
									But recently, my family has fallen on some hard times. Despite these hard times in my life, I still continue with school
								and other after-school activities in order to keep myself busy. Despite thinking I was going to go into something art related,
							that certaintly backfired! I ended up deciding on a career in cybersecurity. I have gotten through most of my education. I still
						have 1 year left of high school and getting a college degree. These projects ought to give a look into some aspects of my life. Also
					here is my contact info if you wish to contact me with any further questions.</p>
